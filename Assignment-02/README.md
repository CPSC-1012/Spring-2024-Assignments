The input for this program is an employee ID number, the hourly rate of pay, deductions and the number of regular and overtime hours worked. Note: gross pay is the sum of the wages earned from regular hours and overtime hours; overtime is paid at 1.5 times the regular rate. Net pay is the amount of money given to the employee (gross pay less taxes and deduction). The tax rate is 30% of gross pay. Display the monthly gross pay, tax withholding and net pay as monetary amounts.
